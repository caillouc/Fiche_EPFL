# General

* $b \in \mathbb{Z}^*_p$ has a quare root if and only if $b^{\frac{p-1}{2}} \mod p = 1$

# Diffie Helman

* We check that $X$ and $Y$ are in $\langle g \rangle$
* Use a KDF to fix bad distribution of $g^{xy}$
* We wheck the lower order $X \neq 1$, $X^2 \neq 1$
* If $n = pq$ then $\mathbb{Z}_n$ ring is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p \times\mathbb{Z}_q$ and
  $\mathbb{Z}_n^*$ ring is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_p^* \times \mathbb{Z}_q^*$

# RSA

* Square and multiply algorithm to compute $x^e$ or $x^d$
* Primality test : Verify that a number os prime
* To check if a number is coprime is another one use euclid algorithm
* To compute the inverse of an elem use extended euclid algorithm
* $\varphi(p^\alpha) = (p - 1)p^{\alpha - 1}$
* We can compute square root of $n$ in $\mathcal{O}(\log n)^3$

# Elliptic Curve

* All finite fields have a cardinality of form $p^k$ where $p$ is a prime number
  This prime number $p$ is called the **characteristic** of the field.
* A **binary** field is a field with characteristic equal to $2$
* Over a field $\mathbb{R}$, an elliptic curve with parameters $a$ and $b$
  consists of a special point $\mathcal{O}$ called the *point at infinity* and
  the points $(x, y)$ which are the solutions of the equation $y^2 = x^3 + ax + by$

* Elliptic Curve over a **Prime Field**
  * The **discriminent** is $\Delta = -16(4a^3 + 27b^2)$
  * The curve is **non-singular** iff $\Delta \neq 0$
  * We define the **j-invariant** $j = 1728 \frac{4a^3}{Aa^3 + 27b^2}$, two
    isomorphic curves have the same j-invariant

* Elliptic Curve over a **Binary Field**
  * **Ordinary** curves are defined by two fieds elements denoted $a_2$ and $a_6$
    $$ E_{a_2, a_6}(\mathbb{K}) = \{ \mathcal{O} \} \cup \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{K}^2 ; y^2 + xy = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_6 \} $$
  * We define the **j-invariant** $j = \frac{1}{\Delta}$

* Simple factoring method : Pollard's (also called $p-1$ algorithm)
* **Elliptic Curve Method** (ECM) is the best method to find $p$ when it is
  small
* **ECDH** key exchange protocol is tha variant of Diffie-Hellman protocol
  working over an elliptic curve group
  * We have two participant $U$ and $V$ using the same subgroup of order $n$
    genrated by some point $G$ over an elliptic curve.
  * They both select their secret key $d_U, d_V \in \mathbb{Z}_n^*$
  * They compute their public key $Q_U = d_U.G$ and $Q_V = d_V.G$ which are
    point and exchange them.
  * Then, they both check that the received publoc key is actually a point of
    the curve which is generated by $G$, different from the point at infinity,
    and that its order is a factor of $n$.
  * They both compute the a point $P$, either by $P = d_U.Q_V$ or by $P = d_V.Q_U$
  * They take the first coordinate $x_p$ of $P$ and convert it into a byte
    string $Z$
  * Finally they compute $K=KDF(Z)$
